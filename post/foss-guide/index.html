<p>Open source is a great way to mildly annoy Hacker News, but sometimes
accidentally gives value to someone. With permission from my work here is an
edited version of a FOSS guide I wrote. You will find an overview of what to
expect from open sourcing your projects, along with some good practices. This
was originally intended for teams, but mostly also applies for individuals and
hobby projects.</p>

<p>Most of the advice here will be common sense, as they are good practices in
general. Any effort to make your project approachable to strangers is also
beneficial within an established team.</p>

<h2 id="what-kind-of-work-is-worth-sharing">What kind of work is worth sharing?</h2>

<p>As a collective you have already determined which sections of your codebase are
critical to your competitive advantage, and therefore must be kept secret.
Everything else, I would say, is worth sharing in some form.</p>

<p>If you do not believe other developers could gain value from your work then you
are either wrong or the work isn&rsquo;t valuable to you. Projects that you share do
not have to be the next Hacker News fad, or explode with stars overnight. You
are offering some problem solutions that you couldn&rsquo;t find elsewhere, that&rsquo;s all
that a project needs.</p>

<p>Obviously the world might survive without another FIZZ/BUZZ implementation or
JavaScript framework. If your work is genuinely already solved elsewhere then
maybe use this as an opportunity for self reflection, why did you build this
software in the first place?</p>

<h2 id="what-does-a-foss-project-need">What Does A FOSS Project Need?</h2>

<p>Short answer: All the same stuff as a regular project.</p>

<p>More thorough answer:</p>

<ul>
<li>A project root README

<ul>
<li>A concise description of the project purpose and goals.</li>
<li>List of dependencies</li>
<li>Build steps where applicable</li>
<li>Code examples where applicable</li>
<li>Contact information for the maintainers</li>
<li>Rules for contributing (link to coding standards etc)</li>
<li>A license declaration</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Clean layout

<ul>
<li>The project should be modular and self contained where possible</li>
<li>Unit tests with a good standard of code coverage (use best judgement)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Well documented code

<ul>
<li>Comments where appropriate</li>
<li>README for larger isolated components of your project</li>
<li>Configuration examples (up to date!)</li>
<li>Code examples (more in depth than the README)</li>
<li>Architecture diagrams and high level design documents</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-will-the-community-do-to-me">What Will The Community Do To Me?</h2>

<p>Your mileage will vary when it comes to interacting with an online community,
but here are some key themes I discovered across my projects.</p>

<h3 id="initial-reception">Initial Reception</h3>

<p>Most likely the first thing that will happen when your repo goes public is&hellip;
Nothing. Even when posting your project in various online forums you can expect
to be met with very little attention.</p>

<p>It is important to understand that this is not a reflection on the project or
the author, as it takes time for a project to gain momentum. Even if your
project initially gains lackluster response, it is never more than a single post
from exploding with attention given the correct circumstances.</p>

<p>Do not let a lukewarm reception drive you away from maintaining your project.</p>

<h3 id="feedback">Feedback</h3>

<p>A natural human reaction to being bombarded with feedback from strangers is
either being defensive, overcome with woe, or both. You need to keep a clear
head when reading feedback and remember that this process is meant to help you
and the project improve, and not a punishment.</p>

<p>It is a great idea to record and respond to all feedback received, but to help
you stay in control of the flow you should categorise it. I tend to split
feedback into the following:</p>

<h4 id="technical-issues">Technical Issues</h4>

<p>Bugs and general design problems are the gold you are prospecting. This is an
actual problem that needs addressing (sooner rather than later). When real
problems are revealed by the community (sometimes even fixed) make sure you
thank and credit those people since they have spared you from impending pain and
suffering.</p>

<h4 id="documentation-issues">Documentation Issues</h4>

<p>Most of the feedback or questions you receive will likely be due to gaps in
documentation. This also includes a general misunderstanding of your project or
its goals. If appropriate then use these as opportunities to update and improve
your READMEs, comments etc.</p>

<p>Genuine and reasonable misunderstanding should be permanently dealt with, don&rsquo;t
just respond to the individual and move on. However, some people on the internet
are just trolls or contrarians, make a judgement call.</p>

<h4 id="feature-request">Feature Request</h4>

<p>Take note, some of these are great ideas and should be done, some should be
rejected, others can be left as an issue with the &ldquo;Help wanted&rdquo; tag. These are
the hardest to triage and respond to as they require thought and consideration.
Do your best and be polite.</p>

<h4 id="design-disagreements">Design Disagreements</h4>

<p>If someone has a problem that isn&rsquo;t any of the above then it&rsquo;s probably a design
disagreement. Not everyone has the same priorities or issues as you do, some
people will try and shoehorn your project into their problem space.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to lose significant time to these conversations so try and be
respectful, but do not be afraid to reject requests and feedback that you don&rsquo;t
feel will fit the project.</p>

<h4 id="laziness">Laziness</h4>

<p>Be wary of the fabled &ldquo;Lazy Dev&rdquo;, many requests may seem to fall into one of the
above categories, when they are in fact a thinly veiled attempt to extract code
examples or bespoke documentation from you.</p>

<p>Politeness is key to all community dialog, but be willing to refer some folk to
the documentation or codebase when their requests are trivial.</p>

<h4 id="forks">Forks</h4>

<p>People will fork your project. Lots. Github forks are very often used as
bookmarks. If a high profile organisation forks your project they will likely
contact you if they intend to do significant work to it. My advice is to ignore
forks until you see a pull request.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Looking after a FOSS project is fun, extremely rewarding, and mostly common
sense. The key things to get right are politeness, managing your time whilst
being responsive, and keeping in mind that you aren’t working for the community,
you are working together.</p>
